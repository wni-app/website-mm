## What we do
We build apps for Microsoft Teams, Slack, and other messaging platforms.  Our apps are bots behind the scenes, and are built on the [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-services/) using [Bot Framework Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/).  This technology stack is very flexible, and supports most messaging platforms.  Our approach is to keep app capabilities focused on a core use-case so the app can be as simple as possible.  
## Contact us
