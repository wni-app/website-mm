## What we do
We build apps for Microsoft Teams, Slack, and other messaging platforms that are targeted at business use-cases.  Generally these center around improving productivity by making existing work processes more efficient.

## How we do it
Our apps are bots behind the scenes, and are built on the [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-services/) using [Bot Framework Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/).  This technology stack is very flexible, and supports most messaging platforms.  Our approach is to keep app capabilities focused on a core use-case so the app can be as simple as possible.  This makes apps easier to understand for both users and administrators.  It also tends to require the fewest security scopes, since the app does fewer things, and that improves security.

## Who we are
WNI is an initialism for Whistler Networks Inc., which is based in Whistler, Canada.  Yes, we spend a lot of time skiing, snowboarding, and mountain biking.  But when we're not doing that, we have a lot of fun building apps for Microsoft Teams and other messaging platforms.  We run our business using the same tools we make for others, and often that is the motivation for building them in the first place.
