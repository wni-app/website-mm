## What we do
We build apps for Microsoft Teams, Slack, and other messaging platforms.  Our apps are bots behind the scenes, and are built on the [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-services/) using Node.js.  

We publish apps to the app stores for use by end-users out-of-the-box.  We also customize these apps for customers that have similar, but unique, requirements.  Volume licenses with source code are available.  We will also consider requests for building entirely new apps.

## Contact us
If you have support or other questions, please [email us](mailto:info@wni.app).
