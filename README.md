# Your Issues are Welcome Here!
This repo is just for our website, but we'd encourage you to submit issues here for any of the following:

## Documentation
- Corrections or things that don't make sense.  It would be awesome if you could provide a link to the relevant paragraph. 
- Suggestions for adding new material, videos, etc.

## Reporting Bugs
-  Opening an bug issue here will make it easier for us to keep all the dialog about it in one place, and you can see when it gets closed with a fix.

## Feature Requests
- All feature ideas will be reviewed.
- Ideas for entirely new apps are also appreciated.
